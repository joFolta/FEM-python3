### 🥚 Easter egg (Python Philosophy)
- Enter REPL (>>>) in terminal with "python"
- type "import this"

*The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters*

*Beautiful is better than ugly.*
*Explicit is better than implicit.*
*Simple is better than complex.*
*Complex is better than complicated.*
*Flat is better than nested.*
*Sparse is better than dense.*
*Readability counts.*
*Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.*
*Although practicality beats purity.*
*Errors should never pass silently.*
*Unless explicitly silenced.*
*In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*
*There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.*
*Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.*
*Now is better than never.*
*Although never is often better than *right* now.*
*If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.*
*If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.*
*Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!*

### 🐍 Style Convention: snake_case
- lower case words
- use underscore for spacing

*Everything is a object in Python*
*True + True => 2*
*True = 1*
*False = 0*

### Keywords:
- None 
- True
- False
- list
- str

### Helpful REPL (>>>) methods:
- type() - checks type of a variable
- dir() - show me all the methods for this type
  - eg. dir(str)
    - ignore double underscore ones
    - lists all methods for str
- help()
  - eg. help(str.isalpha)
    - help on method (str.isalpha) / class (like str)
    - space to scroll down
    - q to exit

### Numbers in Python
- integers
  - type(5) 
  - int(5.2) => 5
- floats 
  - type(5.2) 
  - float(3) => 3.0
- complex
   - type(25p)

- power
  - 2 ** 3 => 2x2x2 => 8
- min
  - min(1, 5, -3) => -3
- max
- round
  - round(3.1) => 3
  - round(3.9) => 4
